# Welcome to FocusFlow!

The IDE built on the science of well-being and intellectual vitality. We believe that the key to being a truly effective developer lies in a balanced, healthy lifestyle, inspired by the best of what science tells us—like the benefits of a plant-forward diet and a mindful approach to daily habits.

FocusFlow is not just about improving your code; it's about helping you become the best version of yourself, so that you can create solutions that truly make a difference. This is a space for those who are committed not just to excellence in technology, but also to compassion and sustainable living. Join us in creating a future where technology and well-being go hand in hand, and where we all thrive together.

## Cognitive Bandwidth Router Prototype

The `cognitive_router` package under `src/` is a runnable scaffold for routing AI-agent tasks to humans based on SLO risk, model confidence, and an attention/load signal derived from lightweight telemetry. See `docs/cognitive_bandwidth_router.md` for the architecture overview, simulation instructions, and next steps.

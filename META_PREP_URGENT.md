## 4-DAY PREP PLAN (Nov 9-13)

### SATURDAY NOV 9 (TODAY) - 6 hours
**Priority: Get oriented + basics**

**Morning (3 hours):**
- [ ] Review Meta's network infrastructure scale (read their engineering blog)
- [ ] Document your actual network experience (what you've built, scale, technologies)
- [ ] Practice explaining complex network concepts simply (VLAN, BGP, routing, etc.)

**Afternoon (3 hours):**
- [ ] Set up CoderPad account and practice interface
- [ ] Solve 3 EASY LeetCode problems in Python
- [ ] Review Python basics (lists, dicts, loops, functions)

---

### SUNDAY NOV 10 - 8 hours  
**Priority: Deep technical prep**

**Morning (4 hours - Networking):**
- [ ] Research Meta's datacenter network architecture (Fabric, BGP design)
- [ ] Prepare 3 stories: largest network you managed, toughest outage, automation project
- [ ] Practice answering: "How would you scale a network from 100 to 10,000 servers?"
- [ ] Review BGP, OSPF, datacenter fabrics (Meta uses these at scale)

**Afternoon (4 hours - Coding):**
- [ ] Solve 5 MEDIUM LeetCode problems (arrays, hashmaps, strings)
- [ ] Focus on: Two Sum, Valid Parentheses, Merge Intervals, Binary Search
- [ ] Practice explaining your thought process OUT LOUD while coding
- [ ] Time yourself - 20 min per problem max

---

### MONDAY NOV 11 - 6 hours
**Priority: Interview simulation**

**Morning (3 hours - Networking):**
- [ ] Mock interview: Have ChatGPT ask you network design questions
- [ ] Practice whiteboarding network topology on paper
- [ ] Prepare questions to ask interviewer about Meta's network
- [ ] Review: How Meta built their automation (they use custom tools, not just Ansible)

**Afternoon (3 hours - Coding):**
- [ ] Solve 5 MORE medium problems on CoderPad (not LeetCode - use the actual tool)
- [ ] Focus on graph problems (BFS, DFS) - common at Meta
- [ ] Practice coding WITH voice explanation (talking through logic)
- [ ] Review Python string manipulation, list comprehensions

---

### TUESDAY NOV 12 - 4 hours
**Priority: Polish + systems thinking**

**Morning (2 hours):**
- [ ] Review Meta's infrastructure philosophy (move fast, scale, reliability)
- [ ] Prepare answer to: "Why Meta?" (Be honest: scale, impact, learning)
- [ ] Practice your introduction (30 seconds: who you are, why network engineering)
- [ ] Prepare 3 questions for each interviewer

**Afternoon (2 hours):**
- [ ] Solve 3 HARD problems (stretch goal - good if you can, ok if you can't)
- [ ] Review all previously solved problems - can you do them faster?
- [ ] Practice explaining trade-offs (time vs space complexity)

---

### WEDNESDAY NOV 13 (DAY BEFORE) - 3 hours
**Priority: Final review + rest**

## CRITICAL RESOURCES

**Network Prep:**
- Meta Engineering Blog: https://engineering.fb.com/category/networking-traffic/
- Focus on: datacenter fabric design, BGP at scale, automation philosophy

**Coding Prep:**
- CoderPad Sandbox: https://coderpad.io/sandbox
- LeetCode Patterns: Arrays, Hashmaps, Strings, Graphs
- Meta typically asks: practical problems, not obscure algorithms

**Key Insight:**
Meta is one of the 10% that ACTUALLY NEEDS automation. They built Batfish and custom tools because off-the-shelf doesn't work at their scale. Show you understand the difference between automation theater and actual engineering at scale.

## BANDWIDTH ALLOCATION THIS WEEK

**BLOCK EVERYTHING ELSE:**
- No new job applications
- No AutoCon prep yet (that's Nov 17-21)
- No deep dives on other topics
- Pearl can wait (you already replied)

- **Status**: Never followed up on form request
- **Email**: e.solberg@huxley.com  
- **Role**: IT Network Engineer at X (Twitter)
- **What Happened**: You had a call with him Sept 19, he said you'd be "a great addition to the team," asked you to complete a form. You never responded.

- **Decision**: Interview for practice, but don't over-invest (you don't want on-site job)
- **Action**: Complete form before interview, light prep only

### 3. **Loui Cowles - Cisco Firepower Remote Role** (Oct 14, 2025)

- **Email**: loui.cowles@vividresourcing.com

- **What Happened**: "Thank you for taking the time to apply and interview... [rejection]"
- **Decision**: Closed door
- **Action**: PARK

## Patterns Discovered

**What's falling through the cracks:**
1. **Forms/administrative tasks** - You interview well, then don't complete paperwork
2. **Remote opportunities** - Loui's Cisco role is exactly the kind of thing to track
3. **Follow-ups after positive calls** - Ethan said you'd be great, then silence

**What you're NOT missing:**
- Generic recruiter spam (correctly filtered)
- Job board alerts (ZipRecruiter, Lensa, etc.)
- Automated rejection emails

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 24 Hours)
1. ✅ **Complete Meta US Work Authorization form** - Interview is in 4 days
2. **Light Meta prep** - 2-3 hours total, don't over-invest
3. **Respond to Loui (Vivid Resourcing)** - Remote Cisco role could be backup income

### This Week (Before AutoCon 4)
1. **Research OpsMill's Infrahub platform** - 2-3 hours deep dive
2. **Prepare talking points for meeting Pete** - AutoCon 4 Nov 17-21
3. **AutoCon 4 presentation prep** - Your network automation adoption talk

### Not Worth Pursuing
- ❌ Ethan/X role - On-site hyperscaler, not your goal
- ❌ Riley/Apex - 3 months old, likely filled
- ❌ Any new on-site opportunities

## VIP Tracking (Current)
- **Pearl Collings** (gypclany@yahoo.com) - Datadog recruiter, waiting for response
- **Pete Crocker** (pete@opsmill.com) - OpsMill, THE job you want

## Bandwidth Allocation (Correct Priority)
- **85%** - OpsMill application + AutoCon 4 prep
- **10%** - Meta interview (light prep, practice only)
- **5%** - VIP watching (Pearl, Pete)
- **0%** - Everything else until after Nov 21

---

**Bottom Line**: You're not missing critical opportunities. The router is working - it found the Meta interview you forgot, would have caught Pearl's 19-day gap, and identified Ethan's dropped form. The real issue isn't tracking MORE stuff, it's **saying NO to distractions** and focusing 85% of bandwidth on OpsMill.
